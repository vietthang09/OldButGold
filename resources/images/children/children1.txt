Here for sale is a well loved kids climbing frame, it has a ladder one side and a walkway with a steering wheel and a pair of binoculars, then u slide all the way down the slide. It does have climbing slots along the sides. Kids will have lots of fun with this in their garden. Our kids used a sheet over the top and it was their secret den. Lolol.
