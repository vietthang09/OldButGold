This is an original 1950s cream/ivory, bakelite GPO dial telephone model 328L with bottom drawer for the directory. All in lovely restored condition. The base is stamped 1957. The dial is chrome with alphanumerical details and the braided cord is new as the original cord was defunct. The bell on/bell off switches work as they should. Has a lovely traditional ringing sound. The ‘telephone exchange’ button has no function on modern lines. A lovely item from the 1950s.
