1966 Landrover Series 2a with Excellent Chasis including new Cross member,Out-riggers and Dumb ion’s completed. Original Start button under dash and all Electrics working. 31714 on the clock but cannot be verified. Front Radiator Panel, 2 door tops and the under seat Tool box could do with replacing to make this a fine example of this TAC exempt , MOT Exempt Landorver. A complete respray would Tripple the value of this fine example however it’s current state continues the nostalgic look and feel of this vehicle. Currently for sale due space constraints as I am working on another Landrover at present.
