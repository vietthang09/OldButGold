-KIDDICARE CHILDS CAR SEAT 2-3 YEARS UPWARDS
This is a Kiddicare childs Isofix car seat with rear anchor strap as well it has had very little use as was bought when our Granddaughter come to stay it also has an alarm so if the child was to tamper with the buckle it sounds it is in excellent condition and has been in no accidents it is for collection only it is on other site so please don't ask for it to be held as been let down to many times this cost over £150 when bought so a real bargain for someone who needs a very good child's seat it also comes with the rear seat anchor strap this cost £25 on its own
